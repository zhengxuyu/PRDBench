## PRD: Password Security Analysis System Based on Keystroke Pattern Recognition

---

### 1. Requirement Overview

This project outlines the design and development of an intelligent password security analysis system based on keystroke pattern recognition. The system aims to significantly enhance the accuracy, interpretability, and utility of password security assessments by addressing a critical gap in traditional strength evaluation methods: the omission of keyboard spatial distribution features. It will provide crucial data support for both academic research and practical applications in password security.

Key Innovations:

-   Reconstructs the password strength assessment framework by introducing keyboard coordinate mapping and pattern recognition algorithms that leverage spatial distribution features.
-   Integrates multiple keystroke pattern recognition algorithms (e.g., row/column, diagonal, and checkerboard patterns) to provide a deeper characterization of password creation habits.
-   Offers three core algorithmic workflows (pattern recognition, frequency analysis, and password generation) and a hybrid qualitative-quantitative evaluation model based on expert knowledge, catering to diverse scenarios such as large-scale dataset analysis and real-time assessments.
-   Introduces password pattern generation and strength analysis to extract supplementary security features and risk metrics, enhancing the scientific rigor and practical value of password security research.

The target users for this system are cybersecurity researchers, password security assessment experts, and system administrators. The system is designed to support large-scale data processing, algorithm evaluation, and visual outputs, ensuring both extensibility and usability.
