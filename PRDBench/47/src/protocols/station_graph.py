"""StationGraph Protocol — interface contract for the subway network graph.

Any concrete implementation of the station graph (in-memory, file-backed, etc.)
must satisfy this Protocol. Static type checkers (mypy, pyright) enforce
structural compatibility at import time.

Usage example::

    def find_fare(graph: StationGraph, src: str, dst: str) -> float:
        result = graph.shortest_path(src, dst)
